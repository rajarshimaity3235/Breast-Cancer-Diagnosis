# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis

For any person suffering from Breast Cancer , the diagnosis whether the cancer is benign or malignant is imperative.We are going to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign using Machine Learning Models
We have developed  Logistic Regression/ Decision Tree/ Boosted Tree Classifier Models to classify the diagnosis of Breast Cancer cases into malignant and benign.

**Data collection**
We are using the following Kaggle Dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data>.Contains Fine-needle aspiration results.It Contains 32 columns and 569 rows.

**About the Dataset**
Attribute Information:
1) ID number    
2) Diagnosis (+1 = malignant, -1 = benign) 
3) Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
  - radius 
  - texture 
  - perimeter 
  - area 
  - smoothness 
  - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
  - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
  - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

**List of important features :**
- Standard error of fractal dimension
- Standard error of concave points
- Worst concave points
- Mean of concave points

## Logistic Regression Model --
